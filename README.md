# 🙋‍♂️ Hello there!

I'm Claudio an 🌎 citizen, Chilean born and living in Finland. I love software development, drawing and having a good time with people (at work or just chilling)

I normally work with React, JavaScript, Css and Html, but I have also worked with React Native, Java, SQL and learned some Node, Mocha, D3 and Vue. 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and data analysis with Phyton.

#### Feel free to look around and connect. Thanks for passing by 😃 Have a good day!!
